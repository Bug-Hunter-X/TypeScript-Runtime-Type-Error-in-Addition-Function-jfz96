This repository contains a TypeScript example demonstrating a runtime type error that can occur if type checking is not sufficient. The `add` function is designed to take two numbers as input and return their sum. However, if a string is passed as an argument, TypeScript's type system will not detect this during compilation, leading to a runtime error. The provided solution implements additional type checking to catch this issue.
